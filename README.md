This is the source code of my landing page. [It is in productive use here](https://oerdek.com).
[More information about this project can be found here](https://enesordek.com/2022/05/01/projekt-mit-nextjs).

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. Change the content of the landing page in the sqlite-db in `lib/db.sqlite`.

## Build

Deploy
```bash
npm run build
```

Upload the contents of the `out` folder into the file system of your web server. That's it!
